# Federated Machine Learning with Flower: Packaging, Monitoring, Securing
### Presentation: [Presentation_name](workshop/presentation.pptx) (will be added later)

## Workshop description
This repository contains all the code, documentation, and resources you will need to participate in our workshop on Federated Learning using the [Flower package](https://flower.dev/). Flower is a powerful and easy-to-use open-source framework for Federated Learning, allowing developers to easily create and manage distributed machine learning models.

Federated Learning is a development in machine learning that allows models to be trained on decentralized data without the need for centralization. It preserves data privacy, reduces transfer costs, and enables faster model training. This approach has applications in various industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation, where data privacy and security are critical. 

The decentralized nature of federated learning brings new challanges with regards to deploying, packaging, monitoring and training these models. In this workshop we will be discussing these challenges, and we will show you how you could tackle them.

## Credits
This workshop was set up by @mlops-and-crafts, [@atroyanovsky](https://github.com/atroyanovsky) and [@saraperric85](https://github.com/saraperric85).

The workshop code is based on the [flwr sklearn example](https://flower.dev/docs/quickstart-scikitlearn.html) and the certificate generation is based on [this example](https://flower.dev/docs/ssl-enabled-connections.html).
